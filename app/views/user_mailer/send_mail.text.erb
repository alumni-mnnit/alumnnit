Welcome to the MNNIT Alumni portal, 

Thank You for being connected with us! We have built a new MNNIT Alumni Portal. 

1. We found your name and details in our old-database, so your new
   account is automatically created by our web-team.

2. Use your existing email-ID to login.

3. After Logging in please update your details and password.

4. Your password now is <%= @password %>. 

Note - Our team is working extremely hard to ensure that you get the best out of this platform. We welcome your feedback and suggestions to further improvise the concept. 

Cheers!
